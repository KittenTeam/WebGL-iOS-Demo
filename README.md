# WebGL on iOS Demo App

This XCode project is a proof of concept of how to use `WKWebView` to display WebGL applications on native apps without PhoneGap, Ionic, etc.

This Project is missing the WebGL part of it which can be found on [https://github.com/agilityfeat/iOSify](https://github.com/agilityfeat/iOSify).

Be sure to checkout the [blog post on agilityfeat.com](http://www.agilityfeat.com/blog/2015/06/using-webgl-in-ios-without-phonegap-or-ionic) which ties it all in.
